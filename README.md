A Javascript library that enables communication between BLE devices and p5 sketches using Web Bluetooth API.

With p5.ble.js, you can request and connect to nearby Bluetooth devices, read/write Bluetooth characteristics, receive GATT Notifications, know when a Bluetooth device gets disconnected, and even read and write to Bluetooth descriptors.

The library is supported by code examples, tutorials that cover many popular Bluetooth LE devices.

p5.ble.js is inspired by [p5.serialport](https://github.com/vanevery/p5.serialport), [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), and [Web Bluetooth API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API).
