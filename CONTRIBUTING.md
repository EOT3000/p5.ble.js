## Getting Started

If you want to help develop this library, here are the steps to get started:

1. Fork the repository to your account, and then clone it your computer:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/YOURGITHUBHANDLE/p5.ble.js.git
  ```

2. Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  cd p5.ble.js
  npm install
  ```

3. This project is developed using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). Webpack is a module bundler that "bundles" different files into one file. This file is usually called a library.

  Under the `/src` folder there are sub-folders for all `p5ble` methods. Before building the library, you can check to see everything is working:

  - Run this command from the root of the project:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

    That should output something similar to this:

    ```bash
    > p5ble@0.0.2 start /Users/ITPNYU/dev/p5.ble.js
    > webpack-dev-server --mode development --config webpack.dev.babel.js

    ```

    If you see this message, it means the project is actively being built by Webpack's `webpack-dev-server`. Any changes you make to any file in the `/src` folder will automatically rebuild the `p5.ble.js` and `p5.ble.min.js` libraries as long as the server continues to run.

4. Develop!

  Go to [https://github.com/ITPNYU/p5-ble-examples](https://github.com/ITPNYU/p5-ble-examples). Create a new folder called `/yourExample` in the project's `p5_sketches` folder. Create an `index.html` file inside `/yourExample` and add the following:

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
    <title>Test</title>
    <script src="http://localhost:8080/p5.ble.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>

    <script>

    </script>

  </body>
  </html>
  ```

  This is just a simple `html` file that has a reference to the `p5.ble.js` library.

  Next, open the `/src/index.js` file and add this after the last line:

  ```javascript
  console.log('Hello Test Development!');
  ```

  If you now go to `http://localhost:8080/` and open the console, you should see `Hello Test Development!`. As you make changes, you will simply need to reload the `index.html` page to see them.

5. Once you have finished testing, you can build the library. Just close the `webpack-dev-server` and run

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  That should output something very similar to the `webpack-dev-server` from step 3 but you'll notice at the end is this line:

  ```bash

    + 330 hidden modules
  ```

  If you see this, it means the library was successfully built and minified.
